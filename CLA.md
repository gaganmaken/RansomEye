# RansomEye Shield Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") documents the rights granted by contributors to the RansomEye Shield project. This CLA is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

## Definitions

- "You" or "Your" means the individual or legal entity making the Contribution.
- "Contribution" means any work of authorship that is submitted to the project by You.
- "Project" means the RansomEye Shield project and its associated repositories.

## Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You grant to the Project and to recipients of the software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
