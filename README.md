## Data Flow

1. User Authentication & Authorization
   - User logs in through web interface
   - RBAC engine validates permissions
   - Session is established

2. Real-time Monitoring
   - DPI engine captures network traffic
   - Endpoint scanner monitors system state
   - AI models process data in real-time

3. Detection & Response
   - AI models predict potential threats
   - DPI detects command/control traffic
   - Endpoint scanner identifies suspicious behavior
   - Notifications are triggered

4. Reporting & Analysis
   - Data is aggregated and stored
   - Reports are generated in CSV/PDF
   - Historical data is maintained
   - Analytics are performed

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
